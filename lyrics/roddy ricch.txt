Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive meI don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together
Mustard on the beat, ho
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty
All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?Mustard on the beat, ho
Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause
High fashion like Goyard
G-Wagon or the Rover?
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah
Ahh, woah
You ain't gotta deal with none of these niggas no more
If we hop in the Benz is that okay?
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae?
I ain't no player, I just got a lot of baes
But let me tell you, I like you a lot, bae
I wanna start at the top and the bottom, bae
Know you want the shoe with the red at the bottom, bae
You know I like when you ride at the top, bae
She want Chane'-ne' and Dio'-o'
I'm only doin' cash out, I don't need promo
I pull up to the high rise, I'm in the four-four
Inside cocoa
If I got a feeling, I keep it inside my heart
And I keep a Patek, too, 'cause I don't do facades
You see my diamonds even when I'm in the dark
And since you got it, it make you go and do anything you want toBeezo need cash only, you dig?
That boy Cassius
I just been ballin' out every season
Know it’s some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup
I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was ducking them people
Ducking them birds sending out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I'm dripping water nigga, Aquafina
Damn that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I got to leave her
I’m a real street nigga
Gotta keep it a rack with my people
Turn the whole squad to bosses
I can't be kickin' shit like I'm Adidas
Young nigga pullin' up inside the Bentley truck
I just be poppin' shit like hot grease
I remember days sitting at the trap
'Bout to call the plug gotta cop three
Looked up to Pablo Escobar, Money Meech, and Chapo
That's my top three
Bitch I was serving the sidewalk
Then I copped the drop hopped in the streets
You can’t name a young nigga that’s hot as me
All my niggas do murders and robberies
Got about 20 racks in the Robin Jeans
Niggas thinking I won off the lottery
When I hop in the push start with the pound
Niggas know that it ain't no stopping me
Outta town champ like Mayweather
Got a new crib off the boxing ring
Put the new Forgiatos on the Jeep
Run up 30 in a week
I just fuck her I don’t keep
.45 Under the pillow
45,000 in the sheets
I want the bag nigga
I can't trust no ho if I know she ain't married to me
Bitch I done got this shit up out the streets
Red gut period blood on my seats(
We got London on the track
)
(
I'm in London, got my beat from London
)
I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold-hearted nigga, with the blocka-blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?
When I'm in traffic gotta slide with the beam on me
'Cause I keep 'bout ten racks bussin' out the jeans on me
Niggas be hatin', I'm rich, it's all about the cream, homie
If I ever get caught lackin', they gon' slide
Ever since I got the Rollie, I ain't got the time
Flawless diamonds, niggas can't never block the shine
They know I'm ballin' in the city like DeRozan
Gotta keep my niggas 'round me, I can't do the wrong friends
I was knockin' down walls, now they closin' in
Hopped off the porch, and then I hopped inside the Porsche, ayy
Fuck being the side nigga, I'ma be the main course
Whipped the Rolls like a young nigga made for it(
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one
)
I been done ride through another nigga city
I got a brand new Draco with me
Clip got thirty-three, Scottie Pippen
Bitch nigga ain't heard of me, I got a Richard
Drippin', my sweatsuit Givenchy
I brought my strap in the party
And my diamonds offset like Cardi
Got a bad bitch with me, she a Barbie, huh
You don't wanna start with me
Got some hood niggas postin' in Le Jardin
I have his nigga on back of a carton
Spend Larry Bird, thirty-three on Cartier
I got thirty-three bitches with me
I'ma float through the city sippin' on some chardonnay
Fuck it, I'ma buy it out the bar today
Fuck it, I'm buying out Barney's, yay
I'ma hang with the gangbangers
He only hang with the feds and the rats and the mice
If my young nigga pull up with the bullets
I'ma pull up with the strap, we gon' get him on sight
We gon' make a thriller like Mike
Car candy painted, Mike and Ike
And my diamonds lookin' like a light
I'ma fly a private like a kite
Got the Bentley coupe in China white(
DJ Bugsy
)
(
Swish
)
I just lost my dawg
Nigga, my brother taught me how to chase the bag
Get right in the field, I had to make a bag
The day he lost his soul, wish I could take it back
I just wanna go get one more bag with my nigga
Wanna be rich forever for my dawg
Supposed to take you on yo first trip on a private jet
I vow to always ball until I fall
And we been on this money shit for years
Gotta drink this mud to make the pain go away
I been droppin' these codeine tears
Prayin' Roddy Ricch don’t go insane today
We was in the high speed like fuck the static
He wanted the Rollie, I wanted the Patek
Got to get this safe, my nigga, fuck around and drag it
I done seen a lot of shit behind these glasses, yeah
My life goin' through many different phases
Got to keep the gun on me, can't go too many places
Ran in V12 just to mimic drag races
Nigga we was bag chasers before we had bracesScott Storch
A nigga came from the bottom, down below
'Member them cold nights, I was sleepin' on the floor
Always dreamed about the Forgiato feet, now they down below
A nigga got so much money on me, I can't count no more
'Member I was in the project walls, couldn't even get a loan
Now these niggas got they hands out, if I ain't give it, I'd be wrong
'Member I was in the county jail none of these bitches wasn't pickin' up the phone
Now they bangin' my line, I ain't got time no more
A nigga started from the bottom, now I'm livin'
Early morning, uncle whippin' in the kitchen
Some people said I couldn't do it and then I did it
Look at my bank account, I'm runnin' up the digits
I ain't into all that "Doin'-that-facade" shit
I walk it, I talk it, I live it
Come to the bird house, look at the garage, nigga
My Bentley coupe got a couple pigeons
I was down on my ass, had to go a new direction
Bought mom a Gucci purse, gave her 10 racks, told her you ain't gotta stress it
It ain't even an emergency and a nigga 'bout to pull up in a 911
Just to feed my dawgs, I told God it's a blessin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)Rose gold Rollie, I'm the nigga put the whole damn hood on, huh
Patron of the New, I had put the drip on
Ask me how many niggas I done put on
My private planes 'bout to fly with the good old
I fuck with bougie bitches, fuck a hood ho
Hit that bitch from the back and told her ditto
Seen the jakes and a nigga had to get low
She looking at the Patek like some Skittles
Her husband been talking tough, I turned her widow
Giuseppe got me on my tip-toe
Why you wifin' on a flip ho?
Brought the strap, I'm playin' give 'n' go
Serving junkies out the window
Tried to rob us, got extendo
We ain't playin', no pretendo
Sipping on this codeine, a nigga gotta speak my mind, mm-mm
I remember we was havin' po-po 'nem behind, yeah, yeah
I'm gettin' money, I can see the hate inside his eyes, yeah, yeah, huh
Fuck a bitch, I had to grab her by the waist
Hit the pussy 'til I knock it outta place
In the V12, get a lot of face
Spare the details, finished on her face
And I had the strap when I caught my case
Just got the grow house started in the Bay
I made a hundred plays in a day
Put an Arabic bitch inside of the face
And I got the hood damn near riding every day
Putting money on the opps, no face, no caseI'm from the bottom of the bottom, check your sources, baby
I'm a war baby, but I can't divorce the pavement
I'm a hood nigga that turned rich so I got Dior's latest
And you know I gotta stick to my roots, I still rock Jordans, baby
 (Yeah)
It was hell in the projects, I survived the storm
Got brothers in the sky, they die 'fore they born
I know the worst conditions make a champion
Look at my ice, froze like a mannequin
I'm underwater like I'm swimmin' and panickin'
Body bags zipped up like a laminate
The only solution for the opps is to stay inside
How your niggas say they rock, but they don't slide?
'Cause we was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway (Yeah)
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da (La-da, la-da)
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby (Mhmm)
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby (Mhmm)
Like the mob ties in Houston, we got rag ties
I pray the Lord forgive me the day that I got baptized
'Cause I'ma clutch the sticky every time a car passin' by
I don't wanna be Ricky or another victim to homicide
'Cause I know the soul never dies
I make the chrome-chrome fly
Bitch, I'm a wave, Roll Tide
Bullets at your face, Botox
My persona done got her tongue-tied
I was taught that a legend never dies
When it's time, gotta let the lead fly
'Cause I'm a war-war-war baby
Post-traumatic stress, I know the war changed me
Had to bend back but they could never break me
Had to slide
